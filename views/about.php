            <br> daMOVIES is back to being independently owned, thanks to fashion industry veterans, Go Global Retail!
            Since daMOVIES’s breakout in 2002 as an indie brand that championed a vintage, feminine, and fun fashion aesthetic, Go Global Retail has always admired daMOVIES’s unique product assortment and mission to empower and uplift women through their brand values.daMOVIES 2002 — Today
            From daMOVIES’s outset, we’ve set industry standards in regards to size inclusion, anti-photoshopping policies, and female leadership long before it was the norm. Go Global’s mission is to help daMOVIES continue to innovate, and amplify the brand while staying true to its essence.
